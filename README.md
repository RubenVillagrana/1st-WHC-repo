# HELLO WORLD

1st repo on gethub

<body>This repository is to exchange group information for coding and progress on assingments. I have no idea how to code but I'm going to learn or die trying
<body>I hope to learn how to code in HTML/CSS and get certified. I will be retiring in six years and I'm working toward the next chapter of my life.
<body>This course really takes me out of my comfort zone and will help me grow as a person.
